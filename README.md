===================
VCPE Services Demo
===================

* There are 3 service layers in the VCPE demo, each runs independently
    - cosmgr, evcmgr, svcmgr
    - The build creates war files for each that are deployable on tomcat
* Currently the code is housed in private VCPE gerrit repo: 
    http://euca-10-5-5-106.cirrus.cloud.cablelabs.com:8080/#/admin/projects/vcpe-services
* All development and testing to date have been on OSX

Environment Requirements:
=========================
* JDK for Java 7
* Tomcat 8
* Maven 3.3

If you need help with environement set-up instrucitons, see "Environment Set Up" notes at the bottom of this document

Building and Deploying VCPE service managers
============================================
Assumptions
*  You have an account on the vcpe gerrit server
*  Your environmnt has been completely set up as described at the bottom of this document

    $ git clone ssh://yourusername@euca-10-5-5-106.cirrus.cloud.cablelabs.com:29418/vcpe-services
    $ cd vcpe-services
    $ chmod +x ./deploy.sh
    $ ./deploy.sh

* This will build cosmgr.war, evcmgr.war, and eplmgr.war, copy them to your tomcat webapps directory, and start tomcat
* If you prefer to set up manually you can follow the following steps
    $ cd vcpe-services
    $ mvn clean install
    $ cp ./cos/cosmgr/target/cosmgr.war /Library/Tomcat/webapps/.
    $ cp ./evc/evcmgr/target/evcmgr.war /Library/Tomcat/webapps/.
    $ cp ./svc/svcmgr/target/svcmgr.war /Library/Tomcat/webapps/.
    $ /Library/Tomcat/bin/startup.sh

* The 3 vcpe service managers are now running, and will expect/send REST calls on port 9090

Running the ODL Uni Manager Emulator
====================================
* If you would like run the demo without running the ODL plugin, you can do so by running the unimgr emulator.
    - This is a nodejs app that is listening for ODL specific REST calls, and when recieved, it prints the deatils of the call to the console
* In order to run the unimgr emulator, you will need to install nodejs and npm.  See "Install node/npm" in the "Environment Set Up" section at the bottom of this document for more details.
* Before running the emulator, make sure that the ODL plugin is not running (or you will likely get a port conflict on 8181)
* Build the runtime environement, and Start the emulator as follows:

    $ cd vcpe-services/uni/unimgr
    $ npm install (if node_modules does not exist)
    $ node uniMgrEmu.js

* Any REST calls targted to ODL will now be responded to by the ODL emulator,  and logged to the console in which the emulator was started

==================
Environment Set Up
==================

Install JDK
===========
**OSX:**
* Because OpenDaylight requires Java 7, all md-proto development has been against Java 7, so that all components (ODL based, and non ODL based) will be able to run on the same machine if needed
* The md-proto development has been against JDK version 79
    - Download installation package from here:
        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
* Tomcat (and other applications) will require a JAVA_HOME environment variable.  A convenient way to make sure that it is created correctly is to add the following to your .bashrc
    - export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)

**Windows/Cygwin:**
TBD

**Linux:**
TBD

Install Tomcat
==============
**OSX:**
* We are using Tomcat 8, which is the latest version that support Java7
* Download tar.gz installation package from here
    - https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi
    - note: md-proto dev was against v 8.022

* Assuming the tar.gz file is in your ~/Downloads folder:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local (if /usr/local does not already)
    $ cd /usr/local
    $ sudo tar -xvf ~/Downloads/apache-tomcat-8.0.22.tar.gz (or other version)

* For convenience, and to make it simpler to replace this with newer versions you can create a link /Library/Tomcat and point to the version specific tomcat directory (the instructions below assume, and the deployment script assume you have done so)

    $ sudo rm -f /Library/Tomcat (if the link already exists)
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.22 /Library/Tomcat
    $ sudo chown -R -H <your_username> /Library/Tomcat
    $ sudo chmod +x /Library/Tomcat/bin/*.sh

* All of the vcpe services sent to  9090, so make sure that your /Library/Tomcat/conf/server.xml file is configured to have tomcat listen on 9090.

    <Connector port="9090" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" />

**Windows/Cygwin:**
TBD

**Linux:**
TBD

Install Maven
=============
**OSX:**
* Maven can be installed on OSX using brew
    - brew is a package manager for OSX
    - if you donâ€™t have brew installed, do so as described here
            http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-homebrew-os-x-yosemite-10-10-package-manager-unix-apps/

* Now, install maven:

    $ brew install maven

**Windows/Cygwin:**
TBD

**Linux:**
TBD


Install node/npm
================
**OSX:**
* If you plan on running the UNI ODL emluator you will need to install node/npm
* Download and execute the Nodejs Mac OS X Installer (.pkg) from
    https://nodejs.org/download/

**Windows/Cygwin:**
TBD

**Linux:**
TBD
